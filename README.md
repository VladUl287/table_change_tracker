Table Change Tracker - PostgreSQL Extension
A PostgreSQL extension that tracks the last modification timestamp of tables by hooking into the query executor. This extension uses shared memory to store timestamps across all database sessions and automatically updates timestamps on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
